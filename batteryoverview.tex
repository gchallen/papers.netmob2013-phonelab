\section{Usage Examples}
\label{sec-usage}

This section presents five \PhoneLab{} usage examples. Each vignette begins by
highlighting an interesting or important aspect of the usage data we have
collected. Our goal, however, is not to conduct an exhaustive analysis.
Instead, each example continues by discussing how the presented results would
guide the design of future \PhoneLab{} experiments.

\subsection{Overall Battery Usage}

Smartphones are constrained by power, and a large amount of research on
smartphone systems is motivated by energy
conservation~\cite{shye:micro:2009,banerjee:ubicomp:2007,ace-mobisys12}. While
power is a definite concern, evaluating the potential impact of energy saving
approaches requires an accurate breakdown of where energy is used by real
phones. Only then can we be sure we are addressing actual energy bottlenecks and
use Amdahl's law to put relative energy savings into context.

\subsubsection{Energy Breakdown}

A single-day component-by-component breakdown for the entire testbed and
per-participant is shown in Figure~\ref{figure-batteryoverview}. Our results
are similar to those reported by other studies, and indicate that mobile
data, the screen, and CPU usage are the main sources of smartphone power
consumption. The per-participant bars also show a great deal of variation,
with differences in both the amount and the breakdown of energy consumed by
each participant.

One supposedly power-hungry component that has less of an impact than we had
expected is the GPS. This is particularly surprising given the large amount
of location-monitoring work motivated by GPS power consumption. One of
several factors may be at work. First, the Android platform estimates the GPS
chipset current consumption at 50~mA. This number is used by the standard
``Fuel Gauge'' battery monitor and by our calculations. However, it is lower
than the data sheet for the Broadcom 4751 GPS receiver~\cite{bcm4751} and may
represent a best-case average. However, even if the GPS current consumption
is off by as much as a factor of five, it still does not represent a
significant contribution.

Another hypothesis are that Android network location is providing location
with sufficient accuracy for many applications, eliminating the need for GPS.
Or, participants and applications may simply be conscious of GPS power
consumption and taking active steps to control it.

\subsubsection{Future Experiments}

While previous smaller studies on earlier Android
models~\cite{shye:micro:2009} have presented similar taxonomies, the process
of identifying energy bottlenecks must be repeated regularly as hardware and
user behavior changes. \PhoneLab{} provides an ideal environment for
repeating energy usage experiments. Access to a stable set of participants
allows us to identify changes due to participant behavior, as participants
develop an awareness of the power consumption properties of their phones and
how to control them. And as we bring new hardware onto the testbed, we can
repeat power usage experiments to determine differences between smartphone
hardware generations.
