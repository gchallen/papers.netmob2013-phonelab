\section{Usage Examples}
\label{sec-usage}

In this section, we discuss our analysis results in six categories. We have
chosen these categories for two reasons. First, they point to potential future
experiments that can be done on \PhoneLab{}. Second, they highlight the overall
behaviors of our participants.

\subsection{Overall Battery Usage}
\label{subsec-batteryoverview}

We first discuss the overall battery usage. Previous
work~\cite{shye:micro:2009} has done a similar study with a smaller number of
participants (20) and an early Android phone (Android G1). Whenever possible, we
discuss the differences and similarities between our results and previous
results.
