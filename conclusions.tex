\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

We have introduced \PhoneLab{}, a new large-scale programmable smartphone
testbed hosted by SUNY Buffalo. \PhoneLab{} provides a mixture of features
designed to enable the next generation of mobile systems research. Through
five vignettes based on data collected by a preliminary usage study, we have
demonstrated that \PhoneLab{} is useful and usable.

A number of other SUNY Buffalo students have worked on the \PhoneLab{}
testbed, including Micheal Benedict, Rishi Gupta, Jay Inamdar, Mitchell
Nguyen, and Sean Zawicki,
