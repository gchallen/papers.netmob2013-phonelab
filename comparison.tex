\section{Other Approaches for Experimentation}
\label{sec-comparison}

\PhoneLab{} provides features necessary for smartphone research---power,
scale, realism, locality, and timeliness. We define these features as:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item {\bf Scale:} \PhoneLab{} will grow to 700 participants, already
recruited to participate in smartphone experiments.
\item {\bf Power:} \PhoneLab{} allows application-level experiments as well
as platform-level, i.e., Android kernel, middleware, libraries, and Dalvik
virtual machine.
\item {\bf Realism:} Participants use the phones as their primary device.
\item {\bf Locality:} Most participants live in Buffalo near SUNY campuses,
enabling research requiring device-to-device interaction.
\item {\bf Timeliness:} \PhoneLab{} allows researchers to stop relying on
out-of-date datasets. Instead, new data can be collected and customized to
the experiment being performed.
\end{itemize}

We believe that \PhoneLab{} is the only smartphone testbed providing all of
these features together. Table~\ref{tab:comparison} summarizes \PhoneLab{}'s
features compared to other approaches, which we discuss individually below.

LiveLabs~\cite{livelabs} is the most similar testbed to \PhoneLab{}. While it
provides many desirable features, it lacks the ability to perform platform
experimentation. LiveLabs will eventually have three sites---a mall, a
campus, and a theme park---that are instrumented with custom wireless
infrastructure. Their goal is to scale to \num{25000} participants, but
currently only have tens of participants connected. LiveLabs plans to provide
public interfaces to collect processed location and activity information.
Their aim seems largely to support commercial and marketing-driven location
and consumer analytics, rather than smartphone systems experimentation.
However, given that the testbed is still being built, its features may
change.

The standard evaluation methodology when using real devices is to recruit a
small number of volunteers composed of fellow researchers and acquaintances.
Clearly the scale that can be achieved this way is limited, but this approach
also lacks realism. A small number of personal contacts is unlikely to
produce a representative sample, and users in a short-term study are unlikely
to be willing to use a new phone as their primary device. In comparison,
\PhoneLab{} amortizes the recruitment and maintenance costs across multiple
experiments, and provides repeated access to the same participants so that
findings can be verified and competing approaches compared.

A few research tools~\cite{huang:mobisys:2010, zhang:codes:2010} have
demonstrated that it is possible to reach large numbers of users by deploying
the tools on online marketplaces such as the Google Play Store or Apple App
Store. Assuming participants can be incentivized to participate in experiments,
this methodology still lacks power and locality. It is unlikely that
applications distributed via online marketplaces will be downloaded and used by
large numbers of co-located participants. In addition, these online marketplaces
only distribute applications; this prevents researchers from conducting platform
experimentation with core system components.

A particularly challenging kind of research evaluation is the one that requires
large-scale measurement data. Smartphone usage studies and battery
characteristics studies are some of the examples that belong to this category.
This is because large-scale measurement requires a combination of many features
such as scale, realism, and timeliness. This is precisely the reason why we use
our own data collection and analysis as a showcase to demonstrate the power of
\PhoneLab{} in this paper.

In order to conduct large-scale measurement studies, researchers have
resorted to arduous methods such as obtaining and analyzing service
providers' network-level data sets~\cite{xu:imc:2011, trestian:imc:2009,
trestian:ton:2012}, incentivizing a large number of participants
themselves~\cite{falaki:mobisys:2010}, recruiting volunteers through a long
period of publicizing the project~\cite{shye:micro:2009}, etc. Although it is
possible to obtain large-scale traces using these methods, they are nearly
impossible to repeat. As a result, the traces age rapidly and quickly become
obsolete. Our experiment case study described in Section~\ref{sec-experiment}
demonstrates how \PhoneLab{} greatly simplifies trace collection, while
providing access to participants and allowing experiments to be repeated.
