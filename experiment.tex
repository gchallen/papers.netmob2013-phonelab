\section{Experiment Case Study}
\label{sec-experiment}

We have conducted a measurement study in order to demonstrate the power of
\PhoneLab{}; we have developed a logging tool, deployed it on 88 participant
phones, and collected data for 21 days. As mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:comparison}, the reason why we decided to conduct a measurement
study is because it requires a combination of many features of \PhoneLab{} such
as scale, realism, timeliness, and participant control. In a sense, a
measurement study ``stress tests'' the power of \PhoneLab{}.

In order to give a look into how an experiment can be performed on \PhoneLab{},
Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-life-cycle} shows an expected life cycle of an
application-level experiment.
