\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

We categorize our related work into three areas---testbeds, smartphone
measurement studies, and smartphone measurement tools. We discuss each category
below.
\paragraph{Testbeds:} Existing testbeds offer different features depending on
their target domains. For example, PlanetLab~\cite{peterson:ccr:2003, planetlab}
is currently operating more than 1,000 machines world-wide in order to provide
an environment for large-scale, realistic Internet research.
Emulab~\cite{white:osdi:2002, emulab} can provide emulated network environments
with arbitrary network topologies, enabling controlled, repeatable experiments.
MoteLab~\cite{
\paragraph{Smartphone Usage Measurement Studies:} storage~\cite{kim:fast:2012},
diversity~\cite{falaki:mobisys:2010}, network-level
monitoring~\cite{xu:imc:2011}, power usage~\cite{shye:micro:2009}
\paragraph{Smartphone Measurement Tools:}
