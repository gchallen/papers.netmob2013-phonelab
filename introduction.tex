The scale of smartphone network is exploding: from \XXXnote{GWA} in
\XXXnote{GWA} to \XXXnote{GWA} in \XXXnote{GWA}. \XXXnote{GWA: Say something
descriptive about increase in smartphone usage.} Seen as a whole, the
emerging network of smartphone devices represents the most pervasive
distributed system in computing history.

The scale of smartphone experimentation, however, is lagging. \XXXnote{GWA:
Pull numbers from MobiSys'12 papers to make this point.} Multiple factors
account for this smartphone experimentation gap: uncooperative wireless
carriers, closed-source software platforms, lack of user incentives, and the
challenge incorporating human subjects experimentation into a public computer
science testbed. But despite these challenges, harnessing the growing number
of smartphone devices requires expanding the scale of our experimental
facilities.
