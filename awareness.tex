\subsection{User Energy Awareness}
\label{subsec-awareness}

Energy usage on smartphones occurs due to interaction between the phone and
the user. Therefore, understanding smartphone energy usage requires
understanding how users perceive and manage the energy usage of their phones.
Specifically, we are interested in two questions. First, are \PhoneLab{}
participants aware of the energy state of their devices? And second, if so,
when the phone is low on power, do participants take effective steps to
reduce energy usage? We refer to the consciousness of energy usage and
ability to control it among our participants as ``energy awareness.'''
