As smartphones have emerged as the most significant large-scale mobile
platform in computing history the scale of smartphone experimentation has
lagged behind. Keeping pace requires new experimental facilities that enable
research at scale and ensure that research discoveries translate to the
growing network of smartphone devices.

This paper introduces \PhoneLab{}, a 191~device smartphone testbed deployed
at SUNY Buffalo. \PhoneLab{} provides access to an incentivized group of
participants ready to engage in Android experimentation. The testbed will
open for public experimentation in January, 2013, and grow to over 700
smartphones by 2014.

% For initial abstract submission this number is estimated.

To demonstrate the power of \PhoneLab{} we present results from a usage
characterization experiment run on 88 phones for 24 days. A holistic analysis
of our dataset---including examinations of battery, application, telephony,
network, sensor, and location service usage---produces a detailed portrait of
smartphone usage that highlights opportunities for future research.
