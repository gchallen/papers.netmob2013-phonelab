\subsection{Application Transitions}
\label{subsec-apptransitions}

In any computing system, studying its workload is a key to improve the overall
performance. By analyzing how applications behave, we can observe common usage
patterns that arise and optimize relevant components to exploit those patterns.
This is even more crucial for smartphones as they are (yet)
resource-constrained.
